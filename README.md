# LocalWeatherLookup
LocalWeatherLookup is a web-based application designed to provide real-time weather forecasts for any specified location. Utilizing the latest APIs for accurate meteorological data and geographical coordinates, it offers users detailed insights into temperature, precipitation, and other weather-related parameters. 


This repository contains my project for the MIX114 Web Development course, focusing on utilizing JSON and Web APIs to fetch and display weather data. Through this assignment, I've developed a web application that showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the practical use of APIs. The project demonstrates how to retrieve real-time weather information for any given location and present it in a user-friendly format. It's designed to highlight my abilities in creating interactive web experiences and leveraging external data sources effectively.
