# Local Weather Lookup

## Overview

Weather Data Explorer is an educational web application designed to demonstrate the integration and processing of weather and geographical data via external APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface to input an address, which the application uses to fetch and display corresponding weather details.

## Features

- **Address Input**: Users can type in any address, which is used to fetch latitude and longitude coordinates through the Adresser API.
- **Weather Forecast Retrieval**: The application uses the obtained geographic coordinates to query a weather service and retrieve forecast data.
- **Customizable Display**: The web page dynamically displays weather information such as temperature, precipitation probability, and weather conditions.
- **Learning Tool**: The source code serves as a learning resource for understanding how to work with APIs, JSON data, and dynamic HTML content with JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 for stylish and responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript for API interaction and DOM manipulation
- Fetch API for asynchronous HTTP requests
- Geonorge's Address API and Meteorological Institute's Weather API for data retrieval
